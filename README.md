## 🚀 Path to Mastery (Step by Step)

1. **Start with Programming**  
   - Learn Java basics: Variables, Loops, OOP, Collections, Threads, Exception Handling  
   - Move to Kotlin (recommended by Google).  
2. **Setup Tools** → Get comfortable with Android Studio & Gradle.  
3. **UI Basics** → Build layouts, views, and activities.  
4. **Mini Projects** → Create apps like calculator, to-do list, notes app.  
5. **Data + APIs** → Work with Room Database, SharedPreferences, and Retrofit.  
6. **Firebase Integration** → Add authentication, cloud storage, and push notifications.  
7. **Architecture & Advanced** → Learn Jetpack Compose, MVVM, and dependency injection.  
8. **Testing** → Write tests with JUnit and Espresso.  
9. **Publishing** → Upload apps to Google Play Console.  
10. **Professional Growth** → Use GitHub, APIs, cloud (AWS/Firebase), and CI/CD pipelines.

## 🧑‍💻 Pro Tips

- Practice **20 hours of coding per module** (UI, DB, APIs, etc.).  
- Build **at least 5 complete apps** before applying for jobs.  
- Use **official documentation** only when stuck.  
- Share projects on **GitHub** and make your portfolio public.  
- **Publish one app** on Google Play – it proves you are job-ready!
