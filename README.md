## 🧑‍💻 Pro Tips

- Practice **20 hours of coding per module** (UI, DB, APIs, etc.).  
- Build **at least 5 complete apps** before applying for jobs.  
- Use **official Android documentation** only when stuck.  
- Share projects on **GitHub** and make your portfolio public.  
- **Publish one app** on Google Play – it proves you are job-ready!
